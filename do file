//1. To obtain an initial overview of the data, calculate the minimum, average, and maximum values of the variables—opening gross, total U.S. gross, total non-U.S. gross, and opening theatres. How many of the movies in the data set are comedies and how many movies are R-rated?

tab MPAA

//2.Michael London (of Sideways fame) declared in The Hollywood Reporter, “The studio business historically returns around 12 percent a year.” Griffith knew any investor would want justification for such a statement. 

//2.a   Calculate the U.S. return on investment (ROI) (simply defined as the difference of total U.S. box-office gross and budget divided by budget, ignoring any form of discounting) for each movie in the data set. 
gen ROI=(TotalUSGross-Budget)/Budget


//2.b   Provide a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean U.S. ROI of movies. 
ci mean ROI, level(95)


//2.c   Show that the mean U.S. ROI is significantly larger than the 12 percent London cited. 
//The mean of ROI is 29.29%, range between 13.48% and 45.1%
//We set H0 is mean = 0.12, Ha is mean != 0.12
ttest ROI == 0.12
//The P value is 0.0325, which is smaller than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis

//Before Production

//3.a.Compare the total U.S. box-office gross of movies from the comedy genre with movies from other genres. Is there a statistically significant difference between the total U.S. gross of comedies and non-comedy movies? 


//3.b.Griffith was not so sure about the results, because they were contrary to his gut feelings. Maybe higher revenue accompanied higher investments? Calculate additionally the difference of U.S. ROIs from movies of the comedy genre and of other movie genres. Is there a statistically significant difference between the U.S. ROIs? 


//4.a.Is there a statistically significant difference between the total U.S. gross of R-rated movies and movies with other ratings?


//5.a.Based on the described beliefs, determine a sound regression model predicting total U.S. box-office gross of movies prior to production. 


//5.b.Drop all variables from the regression that are not significant at a 10 percent level of significance. Report the final regression.


//5.c.Holding all other explanatory variables in your regression fixed, which movies have higher total U.S. gross, those that are a sequel or those that are not?
