//1. To obtain an initial overview of the data, calculate the minimum, average, and maximum values of the variables—opening gross, total U.S. gross, total non-U.S. gross, and opening theatres. How many of the movies in the data set are comedies and how many movies are R-rated?

//2.Michael London (of Sideways fame) declared in The Hollywood Reporter, “The studio business historically returns around 12 percent a year.” Griffith knew any investor would want justification for such a statement. 

//2.a   Calculate the U.S. return on investment (ROI) (simply defined as the difference of total U.S. box-office gross and budget divided by budget, ignoring any form of discounting) for each movie in the data set. 

gen ROI=(TotalUSGross-Budget)/Budget


//2.b   Provide a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean U.S. ROI of movies. 

ci mean ROI, level(95)


//2.c   Show that the mean U.S. ROI is significantly larger than the 12 percent London cited. 
//The mean of ROI is 29.29%, range between 13.48% and 45.1%
//We set H0 is mean = 0.12, Ha is mean != 0.12

ttest ROI == 0.12

//The P value is 0.0325, which is smaller than 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis

//Before Production

//3.a.Compare the total U.S. box-office gross of movies from the comedy genre with movies from other genres. Is there a statistically significant difference between the total U.S. gross of comedies and non-comedy movies? 

gen Genre_Comedy = 0
replace Genre_Comedy = 1 if Genre=="Comedy"
ttest TotalUSGross, by(Genre_Comedy)
//P-value is 0.1940>0.05, therefore there is no statistically significant difference between the total U.S. gross of comedies and non-comedy movies


//3.b.Griffith was not so sure about the results, because they were contrary to his gut feelings. Maybe higher revenue accompanied higher investments? Calculate additionally the difference of U.S. ROIs from movies of the comedy genre and of other movie genres. Is there a statistically significant difference between the U.S. ROIs? 

ttest ROI, by(Genre_Comedy)
//the difference of mean is 0.5401722-0.1835754
//The P-value is 0.0374>0.05, so it proves that there is a statistically significant. 


//4.a.Is there a statistically significant difference between the total U.S. gross of R-rated movies and movies with other ratings?

ttest TotalUSGross, by(MPAA_D)
//P-value is 0.5026>0.05, so there is not a statistically significant. The mean of R-rated is lower than that of non R-rated (5.33 and 6.12)


//5.a.Based on the described beliefs, determine a sound regression model predicting total U.S. box-office gross of movies prior to production. 

gen lnTotalUSGross = ln(TotalUSGross)
regress lnTotalUSGross Budget Genre_Comedy MPAA_D Sequel KnownStory,robust
//The sound regression model may be lnTotalUSGross = 16.87535 + 1.41e^(-8)Budget + 0.3374525Genre_Comedy + 0.0684639MPAA_D + 0.533817Sequel - 0.1265828KnownStory


//5.b.Drop all variables from the regression that are not significant at a 10 percent level of significance. Report the final regression.

//Check the P-value for each term, we drop the term that with a P-value greater than 0.1 (10% level of significance)
regress lnTotalUSGross Budget Genre_Comedy Sequel,robust
//The final regression model should be lnTotalUSGross = 16.84244 + 1.41e^(-8)Budget + 0.3288883Genre_Comedy +  0.5698926Sequel


//5.c.Holding all other explanatory variables in your regression fixed, which movies have higher total U.S. gross, those that are a sequel or those that are not?

//Because the coef. of Sequel is 0.5747454, which is greater than 0. In this case, sequel movies will have higher total U.S. gross.

//Before Opening Weekend

//6.a.Determine a sound regression model predicting opening weekend box-office gross revenue. Consider both the preproduction success factors as well as the factors describing the opening weekend.

//6.c.Carefully interpret the slope coefficient of each variable in the regression. 


//6.d.Suppose the number of movie theatres showing a movie on the opening weekend increases by one hundred. Provide a point estimate and a 95 percent confidence interval for the expected change in the opening weekend box-office revenue.

//7.a.Run a simple linear regression predicting total U.S. box-office gross from opening weekend box-office gross.

//7.b.If the stronger version of that age-old wisdom were true, that is, if indeed 25 percent of a movie’s U.S. box-office gross revenue came in during the opening weekend, what would the value of the slope coefficient in the linear regression model have to be?

//25% TotalUSGross=OpeningGross
//TotalUSGross=4*OpeningGross


//7.c.Can the age-old wisdom be rejected based on the simple linear regression?

//7.d.Critique the statistical analysis in part (c).

//After Opening Weekend


//8.a.Determine a sound regression model predicting total U.S. box-office gross revenue. Consider all factors known after the opening weekend, including those known before production and those known only before opening weekend, as well as the opening box office gross and the critics’ opinion score.

//8.c.Consider a movie with the characteristics of Flags of Our Fathers. Using the regression from part (b), provide a point estimate and a 95 percent prediction interval for the total U.S. gross revenue of a movie with such characteristics.

//8.d.Advise Griffith on how much he should be willing to invest in order to influence the critics to gain an extra ten points in the opinion score of a movie with the characteristics of Flags of Our Fathers, thereby earning such a film a score of eighty-nine points instead of seventy-nine points.

//9.a.Modify your regression from Question 8 to examine Griffith’s claim. Can you prove his theory?

gen CriticsOpinionComedy=CriticsOpinion*Genre_Comedy	

reg lnTotalUSGross Budget Genre_Comedy Summer OpeningTheatres OpeningGross CriticsOpinion CriticsOpinionComedy,robust



//10.a.Consider a variable called “star power” that reports the number of A-list stars for a movie. If you had data for this variable and added it to your regression from Question 9, what would have to be true for the slope coefficient of star power and how would the slope coefficient of the budget variable have to change for Griffith’s conclusion to be correct? 

Starpower is a ommited variable. If regression model excludes Starpower, it will exist ommited variable bias and the estimated beta will be not consistant with actual beta.
